        <div class="cbp-l-inline-desc">Commissioned by the Three Faiths Forum we created a playful family day inspired by works of art to bring a gallery to life. These pieces had been made by bringing artists of all different faiths and backgrounds together and these as well our physical explorations sought to strengthen community cohesion.</div>
