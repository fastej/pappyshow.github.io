        <b>Where are you from?</b> Liverpool. <br> <b>What's in your pocket?</b> My phone, a chewing gum wrapper and a pen. <br> <b>Most over-used word?</b> Like. <br> <b>Biggest phobia? </b> Being out of control of myself. <br> <b>What one thing would you take on a desert island? </b> Pesto pasta. <br> <b>Song of your youth?</b> Send Me On My Way - Rusted Root. <br> <b>Best would you rather?</b> Fight 100 duck-sized horses, or 1 horse-sized duck? <br> <b>Best PappyShow memory?</b> Either Sope Dirisu falling through a wall, during what I think was a variation of the game Tag. Or the closing sessions during week intensives. Safe space!
