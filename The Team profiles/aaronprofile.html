        <br><br><b>Where are you from?</b> London. <br> <b>What's in your pocket?</b> Wallet, keys and phone. <br> <b>What would you do with the keys to the city?</b> Make technology free areas. <br> <b>Most over-used word?</b> Amazing. <br> <b>Biggest phobia? </b> Anything to do with teeth. <br> <b>What one thing would you take on a desert island? </b> Girlfriend. <br> <b>Song of your youth?</b> I believe I can fly - R Kelly. <br> <b>Best would you rather?</b> Would you rather sleep with your mum in your girlfriends body or sleep with your girlfriend in your mum's body? <br> <b>Best PappyShow memory?</b> My best pappyshow memory is was when did that exercise where everyone was blindfolded. Music was played and we had to just walk around in the space choosing whether or not to react to each other's contact.
