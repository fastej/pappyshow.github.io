        <br><br><b>Where are you from?</b> Birmingham. <br> <b>What's in your pocket?</b> Phone, Wallet, keys, hair tie. <br> <b>What would you do with the keys to the city?</b> Open up all those empty spaces and use them. <br> <b>Most over-used word?</b> Navigate. <br> <b>Biggest phobia? </b> Snakes, Spiders, Rats - anything en masse. <br> <b>What one thing would you take on a desert island? </b> I'd take a 90’s/00’s urban throwback playlist and a sound system. <br> <b>Song of your youth?</b> Miami by Will Smith, 1997 - it represented a place of ‘holiday’ I went there for the first time in 2017 and all his description felt so vivid. <br> <b>Best would you rather?</b> Would you rather have have the power of teleportation or flight? <br> <b>Best PappyShow memory?</b> I remember this one day a game of catch with tennis balls turned into the most epic exercise with around 30 tennis balls bouncing around the space, it was like the crystal maze - we were giggling, hysterical and I couldn’t quite believe how lucky I was to be in a room with some amazing friends really belly laughing to the most orchestral epic music, its was one of those exquisite moments in life.
