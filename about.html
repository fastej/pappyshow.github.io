    	<p>PappyShow – A description of something ridiculous, ludicrous that is being mocked or made fun of.</p>
		<p>The PappyShow are a playful physical and visual ensemble theatre company, using movement and physicality as a 							conduit for storytelling. Formed in January 2013 by Kane Husbands in order to provide a much needed space for actors to train in physical theatre, we use exercise and training to devise and create work. We are a large ensemble of over 20 performers.</p>
<p>Creating stories and motifs along with visual and physical scores is at the heart of the company’s practice. We believe that having a space to play, devise and fail improves us as performers and informs the way we approach our work.</p>
<p>Central to The PappyShow is physical training and personal and professional development. We are committed to offering affordable movement-based workshops for actors and non-actors who are keen to explore physical theatre training opportunities and ensemble techniques to develop an actor’s physicality. We facilitate educational workshops in movement and choreography to share our process of creating work. We work collaboratively, using movement as an active and visceral way to engage in both training and storytelling. These workshops are a great way to get know our company as well as to keep fit and exercise physical and visual storytelling techniques.</p>
<p>Moving forwards we will continue to offer physical training opportunities for actors and non-actors as community cohesion and working together is key to the company’s ensemble ethos. With our performing company, we are currently developing new work to present in 2016.</p>

 

<p>Kane Husbands is a theatre director and facilitator specialising in movement and choreography. He choreographed the Team Welcome Ceremonies at the 2012 Olympics and directed for the Commonwealth Games. He has worked internationally in Europe, the Middle East and East Asia. He has worked with Sheffield Crucible Theatre, National Theatre, Old Vic New Voices, Tricycle Theatre, Midlands Arts Centre, Rose Bruford College, Royal Central School of Speech and Drama and is an active Associate for the National Youth Theatre of Great Britain.</p>
